This is a Flipper application for editing and writing COGES Mykey Dongles. I’m releasing this because idiots are selling similar apps for profit and violating the MIKAI license.

This release is for educational purposes only and comes with zero support. If you message me saying, "Please halp me compile this so I can steal coffee/candy," I will publicly dox you to your school, employer, and the vendor. This is non-negotiable. In that case, you aren't a "hacker" you're just a shitty thief, and you deserve the fallout. Furthermore, if you own a Flipper but can't compile an app with the full source code provided, you have no business using this, get the fuck out.

Redistribution: You are NOT allowed to SELL or PUBLISH this application without the source code and this README. Feel free to update it, but you MUST adhere to these license requirements.

Credit for the original encryption algorithm goes to the MIKAI team.
